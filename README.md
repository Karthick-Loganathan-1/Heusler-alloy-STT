# Heusler Alloy – DFT & KWANT Simulation

This project analyzes the spin-polarized electronic structure of various Heusler alloy using Quantum ESPRESSO and models spin transfer torque (STT) using NEGF-based simulations with Kwant.

##  Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw PDOS data and extracted parameters
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for analysis and Kwant simulation
- `results/`: Plots and output logs
- `docs/`: Abstract PDF and notes

##  Methods Used

- DFT with Quantum ESPRESSO  
- PDOS → Spin splitting, onsite energy, hopping `t` estimation  
- Tight-binding Hamiltonian → NEGF → STT in Kwant (Python)
